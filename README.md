# BigmodeGameJam2026
Game project for [Bigmode Game Jam 2026](http://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2026)

## Theme: Slick
(This theme takes inspiration from last year's Bigmode game jam judging livestreams, where slick was given as high praise for clever or interesting moments. So one option is to simply design something that, when encountered, would make the player say "you were slick for that.")

You are also as always welcome to interpret “slick” in your own way using any definition of the word, just be sure that it serves as the inspiration for your game in a significant way. When you submit your game, you'll have a field you can use to explain how it relates to the theme to make it easier for voters.

## Rules
All work done for the game must be during the submission period (January 29th to February 7th).
All games must involve the theme in a meaningful way.
Games must be appropriate for streaming. Nothing that would get DMCA'd or anything else that would violate TOS.
Games must be single player only.
Teams can be no larger than 5.
No AI generated work.
No VR games, judge won't have a headset hooked up.
